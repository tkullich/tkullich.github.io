  <h1>Highschool Years and Associate Degree</h1>
    <p>I will be honest and tell you that I never imagined myself graduating from a university. I was careless and that was reflected in my 2.4 GPA. Neither of my parents graduated Highschool and there was <strong>no pressure for me to differentiate myself from them</strong>. I saw the struggle they've had with that decision and I decided for myself that I wanted something far greater. I chose to start my higher education by attending Mercer County Community College back in 2013. At first, I had started on a career path in <strong>Criminal Justice</strong>. I soon realized that I wanted to pursue a much more technical career in <strong>Information Technology</strong>. I not only changed my area of study to <strong>Computer Information Systems (CIS)</strong>, but I also changed my entire mindset to pursue a career in technology. As my mindset changed, my attention to schoolwork and assignments became prioritized. I dug myself out of my poor study habits and developed a goal-oriented mindset. <strong>I finished the final semester of my A.S. with a term GPA of 3.89 and cumulative GPA of 3.4</strong>. <br><br>

  <h1>Undergraduate Degree</h1>
    <p>After I have received my A.A. I planned on finding an entry level position while working to obtain various IT certificates (compTIA A+, Network+, Security+, ect). After job hunting for a while with no results, my mindset shifted once again. With the support from my then-girlfriend, now wife, I had decided to pursue my bachelor's degree. I applied to one University at first, <strong>Rider University</strong>. Not only was I was accepted, but I was also given a scholarship that covered half of the tuition. After meeting with one of the advisors, I was given a visual print of the tuition costs and fees after my scholarship. Because Rider is a private university, I would receive close to nothing from state and federal financial aid. <strong>The tuition and fee costs were far too high for me to accept and I decided to decline their offer.</strong>

I soon after applied to <strong>Rutgers University New Brunswick</strong> and heard back a few months later. I was accepted to the School of Arts and Sciences. After seeing the tuition and fee costs, I knew Rutgers was a much better choice for me personally. I had done my research and concluded that I wanted to take part in their <strong> Information Technology and Informatics</strong> program. After my first semester, I was able to apply for entry into the program. I was also prompted to select a minor area of study, which for that, I choose <strong>Human Resource Management</strong>. As I write this in my room, I am in my final semester at Rutgers and in my program. I am proud to say that I have consecutively been on the <strong>Dean's List</strong> every semester I have been attending. I am also delighted to state that I currently hold a <strong>3.9 GPA</strong> and anticipate graduating this spring 21'.  <br><br>
