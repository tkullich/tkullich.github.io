      <p>The major update on this date was the newly designed <b>navigation menu</b> in the upper left corner. The previous version was simple and looked like the following:</p>
      <img src="../navMenu_v1.jpg" alt="navigation menu version 1" class="v1_center">
      <br><br>
      <p>Other changes are as follows:</p>
      <ul class="v1_changelog">
        <li>Removal of style in HTML code</li>
        <li>Addition of CSS styling</li>
        <li>Addition of Changelog page</li>
      </ul>
      <h1 class="section">02/11/2021 changes</h1>
        <p>I was lost in thought last night decided my page was lacking something. For now, I added a new &lt;div&gt; section that surrounds the &lt;body&gt; tag and <b>changed the color</b> to create a two-tone page. I also changed the colors to something I feel blends better. Original layout below:</p>
        <img src="../bodyStyle_v1.jpg" alt="body color version 1" class="v1_center" height="auto" width="900px">
       <p>I also went ahead and corrected my HTML coding for the tables I created on the "Completed Courses" page. In error, I had placed the grades I've recieved within a &lt;th&gt; instead of an appropriate &lt;td&gt;. That has since been fixed. I also went ahead and <b>styled the table with some new CSS styling</b> to differentiate between even and odd cells. See previous version below: </p>
        <img src="../table_v1.jpg" alt="table style version 1" class="v1_center" height="auto" width="950px">
      </div>
    </body>
    </html>
